So here is the file you have all been waiting for: the explanation of how the fuck do those
sensors work!!!

Here is the issue, we want to modify the code in the grisp application since thats where you can find the drivers(grisp/src).
But since grisp is loaded as a dependency the code loaded by default is the one you can find on the following
github link https://github.com/grisp/grisp.

To be able to override this grisp application and write our own, what you can do is create a "_checkouts" dir
at the root level of the application and put a fork of the grisp application in it, you'll need to build once
but then anytime you modify an erlang driver you won't need to rebuild you'll just have to redploy the app.

I have created a "sensor" dir in the git with all the modified drivers.
To test if it works try the pmod_gyro.erl put it in grisp/src instead of the one already there
plug in the gyro sensor on the 12 pin spi1.
Then run:
application:set_env(grisp, devices, [{spi1, pmod_gyro}]).
application:set_env(grisp, devices, [{spi2, pmod_als}]).
grisp_devices:setup().
pmod_gyro:read_gyro().
pmod_gyro:read_temp().
And it should magically work
